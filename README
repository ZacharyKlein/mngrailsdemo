Starting RabbitMQ by way of Docker:

    docker run --rm -it -p 5672:5672 -p 15672:15672 rabbitmq:3-management

The admin interface will be available at http://localhost:15672/.

The username:password is guest:guest.

From there create a Queue named "demomessages".  Next create an
Exchange with any name you like - "mydemoexchange" is fine.  Add
a Binding to the newly created Exchange to bind to the "demomessages"
Queue.
